## Inspiration
We're huge fans of Mai Shan Yun and their delicious noodles (also brown sugar rice cakes!) We were inspired by our love for their food to create this dashboard that can help the management team understand past and future trends, in order to effectively optimize their sales and inventory.
## What it does
Our intuitive dashboard features sections showing different aspects of Mai Shan Yun's data. The first displays sales data by month, which can be further sorted by category of menu item - for example, you can easily find which fried chicken flavor or meat was most popular in a given month. The next portrays an analysis of ingredient usage versus shipments received, with units normalized for quick insights. The last presents a trends and futures predictions page, aimed at providing insightful observations and suggestions. Finally, we present Noodlebot, Mai Shan Yun's personal data analyst living in the sidebar. You can use the suggested questions or ask your own - whether it's about past trends or future recommendations, Noodlebot is equipped to provide expert-level insight!
## How we built it
We built the web application using Streamlit, an open-source Python library designed for data visualization. We used the Pandas library to clean and process the provided noodlicious data. We also used OpenRouter's API Keys (generously provided by MLH!) to create Noodlebot, which specifically utilizes GPT-4o-mini.
## Challenges we ran into
One challenge was learning a new framework, Streamlit. As we were learning, we realized that the convenience of its charting and visualization capabilities came at the cost of reduced flexibility in page design and layout customization.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We’re proud of creating a fun and intuitive dashboard with easy visuals and useful insights. We are also proud of learning how to make a chatbot for the first time!

## What we learned
We learned how to properly hide our API keys and utilize Streamlit to create graphs visualizing data.

## What's next for Mai Shan Yun NoodleBot!
We would like to use a machine learning agent to help predict future trends for Mai Shan Yun. Also, once Mai Shan Yun has been open for longer, we would love to provide insight into seasonal patterns such as trends during the summer vs the winter months.
